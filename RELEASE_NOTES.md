# SleepManager 0.7.2

> **Note**
>
> **Recent AYN and Retroid devices:** SleepManager 0.7.2 can now control Wi-Fi and Bluetooth directly, so the **Compatibility Helper is no longer required** on supported recent AYN and Retroid handhelds.
>
> **Other devices / brands:** install the new **SleepManager Helper** when prompted and grant its **battery optimization exemption**. If SleepManager reports that Wi-Fi control access is required, enable it in **Settings → Apps → Special app access → Wi-Fi control → SleepManager Helper**.
>
> **Warning — AYANEO / KONKR devices with DuraSpeed:** Disable **DuraSpeed** in Android Settings for reliable sleep/wake behavior. DuraSpeed can restrict SleepManager, its Helper and sync integrations in the background, causing Wi-Fi/Bluetooth restoration problems after long standby. **Battery usage → Unrestricted** does not disable DuraSpeed. Disabling it resolved overnight restoration failures observed on a KONKR Pocket Advance.
